Day 1: So here I am. I have all these things that I've done, and I want to put 
them into a website. However, I'm a stubborn mothefucker, and refuse to use a 
service like weebly or wix. Nah, I just had to make my own website despite 
knowing fuck-all about web development. As such, I only see one logical path
forward right now.

Make the website into a shitpost.

Day 2: I had my fun yesterday, but now it's time to actually learn how to make
stuff.
